# HIV-AIDS_Visualisation
This visualisation shows the share of the population in each country infected with HIV from 1990-2019. HIV/AIDS marks a severe development crisis in sub-Saharan Africa, which remains by far the worst-affected region in the world. Approximately 3.5 million new infections occurred in 2001, bringing to 28.5 million the total number of people living with HIV/AIDS in sub-Saharan Africa.
